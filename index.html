    <h2>Benjamin Zou</h2>
    <p>I am Benjamin. I am from China. I came to the US in 2017 when I was in 10th grade. I barely understood English at that time. I was lucky that the school offered an ESL class, so I learned much faster than I expected.</p>
    <p>I love Pittsburgh because of four seasons. The people here are very nice and kind. I am outgoing. I love all kinds of music. I play piano and guitar. My favorite singers are Ed Sheeran, Justin Bieber, and Taylor Swift.</p>
